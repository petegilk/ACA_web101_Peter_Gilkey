              <p>Hi, I'm Peter Gilkey. I live in Leander, TX with my girlfriend Alisha and our dog.
                I grew up in Kennedale, TX, and lived there for 20 years before moving to the Austin area.
                Some of my favorite things to do include playing music, fishing, kayaking, and skiing
                during the winter months in Colorado.

              <p>My girlfriend and I have been living in our Leander home for about 5 years now.
                In April of 2019 we decided to adopt our dog Zeppelin. We enjoy going to the park, going downtown, and meeting new people. 
                In October 2019, I decided
                that it was time to tie the knot with Alisha. We plan on getting married in spring of 2021,
                and yes, Zeppelin will wear a suit.

              <p>I've always been fascinated by how things work, especially in the field of computers and electronics.
                I really enjoy coding because I get to contribute to a greater project. I work best when I have a clear goal in mind,
                and web development allows me to get into that mindset.
